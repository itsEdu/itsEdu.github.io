# JavaScript to play a game? #

You may not have heard of the game [Screeps](http://store.steampowered.com/app/464350/Screeps/), but it is a really interesting game. When I think of JavaScript I generally think of web development, or that language that I looked up but never actually learned. I wish I had. This game relies solely on your ability to develop code with its API to control all aspects of the "rooms" in the game.

Imagine playing a 24/7 Real-Time Strategy (RTS) game that runs code that you write to control the AI in the game while you sleep. That is Screeps. It is a relatively complicated, but really fun game. It is also the funnest way I have found to teach myself JavaScript. I recommend it to anyone that wants a little challenge. :fire:
